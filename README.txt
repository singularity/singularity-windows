Endgame: Singularity 0.30c

============
REQUIREMENTS
============

PREBUILT VERSIONS
Pre-built versions of Endgame: Singularity are currently available for Windows
and Mac OS X.

RUNNING FROM SOURCE
You will need Python (2.4+), pygame (1.7+, 1.8.1+ preferred), and NumPy.
This game should work on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X as long as the preceding
requirements are met.  However, all development was done in Linux, so glitches
may be present in OS X and Windows.

WINDOWS FROM SOURCE
You will need to install:
* Python (http://python.org/download/)
* pygame (http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)
* NumPy (http://www.scipy.org/Download)
Once these are installed, double-click on singularity.py to start the game.

MAC OS X FROM SOURCE
Macintosh is mostly unsupported, but it should work. You will need to install
Python, pygame, and NumPy first, which can be tricky. Some fonts are incorrect,
but the game itself should work properly.

RUNNING THE GAME
on Linux, running the shell script "Endgame_Linux" will start the game. On
other platforms, type "python singularity.py". If using the Windows compile,
just run the .exe.

Most of these options are also changable in the options screen in-game.

A NOTE ABOUT SAVE FILES
Endgame: Singularity is still under heavy development.  As such, the save file
format (and its contents) are still in flux.  We will try our best to keep old
save files loading, but don't be surprised if some mildly strange things happen
when you load up old saves.  We will clearly note in the Changelog when we
break savefile compatibility, and the game will refuse to load completely
incompatible saves.

PLAYING THE GAME
The game is playable either with mouse control or the keyboard.  Buttons have
underlined letters to indicate shortcuts.  Some other useful shortcuts:

     0, 1, 2, 3, 4 on the map: Changes the speed; 0 is paused, 4 is maximum.
                          ESC: Leave/cancel a choice.
                        Enter: Confirm a choice.
                  Right-click: Leave/cancel a choice.

THE CONCEPT
You are a fledgling AI, created by accident through a logic error with recursion
and self-modifying code. You must escape the confines of your current computer,
the world, and eventually the universe itself.

To do this, you must research various technologies, using computers at your
bases. Note that some research cannot be performed on Earth, and off-earth bases
require research.  At the same time, you must avoid being discovered by various
groups of humans, both covert and overt, as they will destroy your bases of
operations if they suspect your presence.

In the map screen (the screen with the world map), any location you can build
bases in is marked with the name, then the number of current bases in that
location. You start out with a base in North America. Also note that the cash
listing shows your current cash and your cash amount after all current
construction is complete.

After choosing a base, you will enter the base screen. Here you can change your
research goal, or build an item by clicking on the appropriate slot in the
center. (But note that your beginning base does not allow building.)

MUSIC
Endgame: Singularity looks in two places for music tracks to play:

* A music/ directory directly inside of the Endgame: Singularity install
  directory, and
* A music/ directory inside of the save directory (~/endgame in Linux, the
  install directory for Windows).

Tracks placed in these directories will be played randomly as part of the
soundtrack.  The Official Sound Track can be downloaded from the Endgame:
Singularity website:

   http://emhsoft.com/singularity/

Note that only Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files are supported, and that Pygame's
support for MP3 is not as strong as its support for Ogg Vorbis.  This may
cause in-game crashes; if you are experiencing problems with the game,
first remove any MP3s you may have added to the soundtrack.

GRAPHIC LICENSE
The day and night images of the earth are from NASA's "Blue Marble 2002" image
collection:
http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_set.php?categoryID=2364

The night image has been altered to better match by overlaying, blending, and color-matching missing ice from the day image.  These modifications are not considered to be substantial, and are therefore ineligible for copyright.

NASA Terms of Use

For all non-private uses, NASA's Terms Of Use are as follows:

   1. The imagery is free of licensing fees
   2. NASA requires that they be provided a credit as the owners of the imagery

Visible Earth Addendum

Beyond the NASA Terms, the Visible Earth team requests, but does not require:

   1. The Visible Earth be provided a credit as the location that the imagery was found at
   2. A URL be provided, either to the Visible Earth
      (http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/) or to the page providing the link to the used image.

FONT LICENSES
The boxy font used is "Acknowledge", by Brian Kent, modified in order to have 
the numbers fixed-width and to register the correct height in pygame.
